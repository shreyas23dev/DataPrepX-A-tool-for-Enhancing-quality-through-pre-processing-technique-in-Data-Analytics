# DataPrepX
## Enhancing-quality-through-pre-processing-technique-in-Data-Analytics
Enhancing data quality through pre-processing techniques is crucial in data analytics. This project focuses on transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis, modeling, and machine learning.
The motivation behind this project is to address the challenges associated with raw data, which often contains missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. By implementing effective data preprocessing techniques, we aim to enhance data quality, making it suitable for accurate analysis and reliable machine learning models. This project is driven by the need to improve data integrity and ensure that the insights derived from data analytics are trustworthy and actionable.

# üß† **DataPrepX** is an **interactive, all-in-one data preprocessing tool** designed to enhance dataset quality before analytics or machine learning.  
It provides a **no-code, user-friendly interface** built with **Gradio**, allowing users to easily handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numeric features, detect outliers, and generate exploratory reports ‚Äî all within **Google Colab** or a local **Jupyter Notebook** environment.

## üîç Key Features

- **Interactive Gradio UI:** Clean, intuitive interface for non-programmers and rapid iteration.
- **Multi-format Support:** Works with both `.csv` and `.xlsx` datasets.
- **Smart Missing Value Handling:** Multiple imputation options ‚Äî mean, median, most frequent, constant, forward/backward fill, or drop.
- **Flexible Encoding:** Choose between Label, One-Hot, or Ordinal encoding strategies.
- **Scalers:** Standard, Min-Max, and Robust scaling for numerical features.
- **Outlier Handling:** Detect and remove univariate or multivariate outliers using IQR or Elliptic Envelope.
- **Feature Selection:** Automatic removal of near-constant or low-variance features.
- **Data Profiling:** Generate a detailed `ydata_profiling` HTML report for quality inspection and EDA.
- **Target Column Protection:** Keeps your target column safe from transformation and reattaches it after preprocessing.
- **Reproducible Pipeline:** Saves all user choices into a JSON file for easy reproducibility and audit.
- **Instant Downloads:** Export cleaned datasets instantly as CSV.
